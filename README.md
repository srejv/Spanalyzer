Just a small test to check sampling of an object over time and updating that object's variables over this time to see the changes.

Use: Run with love. Press spacesbar to stop the sampling. Change the main.lua player update function and see what happens.

Just a fun test project. Nothing serious.

TODO:
  Add some physics, jump and see what happens if we update jump varible while sampling a jump.
  Make the events in the frame samples do something.
